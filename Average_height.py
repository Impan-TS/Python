# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together
# and dividing by the total number of heights.
# e.g. 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
# 1146 ÷ 7 = 163.71428571428572
# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
